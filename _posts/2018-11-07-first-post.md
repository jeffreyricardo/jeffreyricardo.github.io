I don't know why I didn't try this sooner.  Instead of paying for some sort of hosting service, this would be a great alternative for my needs.

I currently have a hosting account with [HostGator](http://hostgator.com), and domains registered with [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com) but honestly it's kind of a waste because I don't really host any content.  Whatever is out there on [http://jeffreyricardo.com](http://jeffreyricardo.com) was merely a test of Wordpress, using a _non-configured_ theme.  

I assume that I'd need to do the following to migrate to this platform.

* Cancel Hostgator hosting account
* Move domain to a cheaper registrar (Google Domains)?
